# ForgeBackup v1.1.0 #

ForgeBackup is a simple mod that sits and backs up your server or single player worlds as you play. No more corrupted worlds due to issues with mods or other issues with your computer, just restore a backup and most of your work will still be saved even if disaster should strike. The initial concept was based heavily on ideas gleaned from BukkitBackup ported to the Minecraft Forge API, however it has now taken on a life of it's own and implements many features not found in the original plugin.

## Installation: ##

Just download MinecraftForge and the appropriate version of this mod for your version of Minecraft from below and place this mod in your **coremods** folder. Again, please note that this is a coremod as of version 1.0 and needs to be placed in your coremods folder.

## Downloads: ##

### 1.5.1 ###

* [forgebackup-universal-coremod-1.5.1-1.1.0.89.jar][b89]

### 1.4.6/1.4.7 ###

* [forgebackup-universal-coremod-1.4.7-1.0.3.83.jar][b83]

## Features: ##

* Perform automatic backups of SMP and SSP worlds.
* Perform manual backups using the /backup command. This command can be used by command blocks if you allow it in the config.
* Basic permissions support to allow anyone or only ops to run backups manually.
* ForgeBackup is only required to be downloaded on the server for SMP worlds. The same download is used for both the client (SSP) and the server.
* Archival backups. These are long term backups which have their own folder and can optionally backup more than the regular backups do. These backups are for longer term storage if needed and are run daily, or on startup if one hasn't been run today yet, and a certain number of daily and weekly backups can be kept. Weekly backups are backups that were taken on Sunday.
* Backups can be created in many different formats, including one based on the `git` application which enables incremental backups. Beware with this, you may not get as much benefit from file-based incremental backups as you may think initially, though worst case this will still only use as much space as the 'none' option.
* Ability to store backups anywhere via the configuration file.
* Automatically clean up old backups (disabled by default).
* Disable certain dimensions from being backed up. Don't backup large dimensions that you don't need or want to.
* Ability to totally configure what gets backed up. Backup mods, configuration and your world, or any other files or folders you may wish to.

## Compatibility: ##

ForgeBackup has a very low surface area that actually touches Minecraft. This means it should be highly compatible with just about any mod out there that isn't also trying to do backups. However, there has been some need for specific patches and so below is a list of other mods we've specifically made changes to accomodate or that we know don't work with Forgebackup.

* ForgeEssentials: ForgeBackup is fully compatible. It overrides and hides the default Backups module from FE if it exists on the server. While ForgeBackup is compatible, there are no plans for integration, so you won't be able to control ForgeBackup via ForgeEssentials.

## Bug Reports: ##

Always happy to receive them, but I can't help you if you don't help me. If you
can't provide a log, then I probably can't help you. Please provide the console
output as well as the ForgeModLoader.log (typically either ForgeModLoader-client-0.log
or ForgeModLoader-server-0.log) from your minecraft folder. Please
[post issues on GitHub][gh-issues] if you are able. I'm also usually available on
[EsperNet IRC][irc] as monoxide.

## Permissions: ##

[ForgeBackup is an open source mod][gh]. It is released under [the MIT license][license].

## Old Versions: ##

I'm not sure of the need for this section since this mod is only required on one side, either the server or the client. Old versions are here for those who want them though.
